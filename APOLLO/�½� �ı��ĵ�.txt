The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission contributed a new chapter in our understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Moon. High-resolution 0.5–2m per pixel images obtained by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) revealed a vast, global network of lobate fault scarps1,2. These scarps are interpreted as the results of thrust faults based on morphology, cross-cutting relations, reversals in vergence, segment linkage and modelling1,2,3,4,5. Their small scale and crisp appearance, cross-cutting relations with small-diameter impact craters and buffered and traditional crater-size frequency distribution dating indicate the fault scarps are very young1,2,6 (Fig. 1). The expected rates of infilling of associated small, shallow graben suggest the lobate scarps are <50 Myr old7. Such a young age raises the intriguing possibility that these thrust faults are currently active.
The population of young thrust fault scarps provides a window into the recent stress state of the Moon and offers insight into the origin of global lunar stresses (Fig. 2a). The widespread spatial distribution of the thrust fault scarps confirms that the Moon recently underwent global contraction. However, analysis of the orientations of the fault scarps shows that the distribution of orientations is non-random2, inconsistent with isotropic stresses from global contraction. The orientations of the fault scarps suggest the influence of tidal forces, and modelling shows that tidal stresses contribute significantly to the current stress state of the lunar crust2. Tidal stresses (orbital recession and diurnal tides) superimposed on stresses from global contraction result in non-isotropic compressional stresses consistent with the thrust fault scarp orientations. At any particular point on the lunar surface, the peak compressive stress will be reached at a certain time in the diurnal cycle. At apogee, the addition of the diurnal and recession stresses are most compressive near the tidal axis, whereas at perigee they are most compressive 90° away from the tidal axis. Coseismic slip events on currently active thrust faults are most probably triggered when peak stresses are reached2.
Lunar seismicity was recorded by four seismometers placed at the Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16 landing sites. These seismometers operated from 1969 to 1977 and recorded 28 shallow moonquakes8,9,10 (Fig. 2a). Analysis of the shallow moonquakes indicated Richter-equivalent magnitudes in the range from 1.5 to ~5 and body wave magnitudes >5.5, with estimated stress drops of ≤10MPa for 16 events and >10MPa for 11 events10,11,12. Three of these shallow moonquakes are estimated to have stress drops of ≥100MPa (refs. 11,12). The large stress drops reported for some of the shallow seismic events may be due to a preslip accumulated stress on the faults.

The current best epicentre determinations for most shallow moonquake locations are probably only accurate to several degrees (60–90km), and are even less accurate for small and/or more distant events from the seismometers. Shallow moonquake depths are also poorly constrained8,9,10,13,14, with some estimated to occur at the surface and others up to depths of 200km. A recent analysis suggests they originate at depths of 50±20km (ref. 14). Although the quality of the Apollo seismic data imposes limits on the accuracy of hypocentre locations, connections between the recorded shallow moonquakes and young tectonic landforms may indicate currently active lunar faults.

The shallow moonquake location and depth uncertainties make a direct comparison with the locations of known tectonic features challenging. Here we analyse the timing and re-evaluate the epicentral locations and depths of shallow moonquakes recorded by the Apollo Seismic Network to investigate the hypothesis that shallow moonquake seismic events represent activity on young thrust faults. We also examined the relationship between shallow moonquake timing and locations to the stress state of the Moon to determine whether moonquakes occur at the times and locations of predicted peak stresses.

It was first necessary to improve the accuracy of the epicentral locations and depths of shallow moonquakes. Past epicentres were determined with the standard method to locate a seismic event, which uses a known velocity model and the observed arrival times of the direct P and S waves8,9,10,14. The reported large uncertainties in arrival times directly translated into the large uncertainties in these event locations. To refine the locations, we applied a relocation algorithm (LOCSMITH) specifically adapted to use inaccurate data from very sparse seismic networks15,16 that requires only arrival time uncertainties. Rather than solving for a best-fit location, this approach divides the solution set into falsified and non-falsified candidate locations using an adaptive grid search and accounts for the arrival time uncertainty using windows around the true arrival time. The result for each event is not a single location, but a cloud of candidate locations (Fig 2b and Supplementary Information). Of the 28 total shallow moonquakes identified by Nakamura et al.8,9,10, 13 have confirmed locations (the location cloud contains the original epicentral location), seven resulted in binary location clouds (two separate clouds of epicentres that do not contain the original location) and eight have fragmented location clouds (the relocated epicentres are not well constrained and are widely scattered). Acceptable locations occur at depths up to 300km, beyond which the search was terminated. However, as modelling of the faults associated with the scarps indicates the depth of faulting is probably no more than 1km (ref. 5) (Supplementary Information) only clouds with surface locations were evaluated. Although surface solutions for the shallow moonquakes were obtained in previous studies, deeper crustal sources were also suggested8,9,10,13, based on scattering properties of the lunar crust observed in the Apollo seismic data14. However, measurements of the scattering properties show that the decay times of the population of surface impact events have a substantial overlap with the shallow moonquake population14,17, which supports near-surface sources for shallow moonquakes (Supplementary Information).

Of the 20 relocated shallow moonquakes, ten confirmed and five binary point clouds have solutions at the surface for a total of 17 possible epicentral locations (Fig. 2b). All 17 clouds or clusters of relocated epicentres either encompass or are near a mapped scarp (Fig. 2b). Among the 17 clouds and clusters of equally viable locations, 17 epicentres were selected based on their proximity (minimum distance) to a mapped fault scarp. Distances between the relocated epicentres and mapped fault scarps range from ~3 to 292km. To more confidently associate a given hypocentre to a mapped scarp, a limiting distance beyond which a moonquake and a fault are considered unrelated must be established.

Ground movement from shallow moonquakes occurs over an area dependent on the magnitude of the seismic event. Seismic waves are much less attenuated in the Moon than in the Earth, and the intense scattering of seismic waves in the heavily fractured lunar megaregolith diffuses the surface and body wave energy into seismic codas of more than one hour18,19. Evidence for strong seismic shaking in the vicinity of these faults is found in degraded and missing small crater populations that extend many kilometres away from the scarps6. Additional evidence is found in crater degradation rates. The degradation rate of small craters in basalts of the Apollo 17 Taurus–Littrow valley (~20.1°N, 30.7°E) is higher than in the Apollo 16 Cayley plains (~9°S, 15.5°E), and the depth–diameter ratio of the degraded craters does not change as a function of distance from the Lee-Lincoln scarp (a distance of >15km)20. This suggests the possibility of a strong seismic shaking throughout the entire Taurus–Littrow valley from slip events on the Lee-Lincoln thrust fault.

In an effort to evaluate the distance from a fault scarp at which significant ground movement is expected from a shallow moonquake, we modelled the seismic shaking for an event on a typical lobate scarp in the Mandel’shtam cluster (Supplementary Information). The maximum seismic moment is equivalated to the total seismic moment estimated from the best-fitting parameters for the geometry, depth and cumulative displacement on the fault obtained from elastic dislocation modelling constrained by the topography of the Mandel’shtam scarp (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Employing the terrestrial shaking intensity scale based on Worden et al.21, the distance from the Mandel’shtam scarp within which peak shaking is strong (Supplementary Information) for the vertical ground motion component is ~30km, and for the horizontal component it is ~17km (Fig. 3). We thus proposed that the effects of seismic shaking from a slip event on a typical scarp can extend to ~30km (~1° on the lunar surface) and we used this estimate to define the limiting distance beyond which a relocated epicentre and a proximal fault scarp are unrelated. If peak shaking at the moderate level is included, the limiting distance could be extended to ~60km (Fig. 3).

Analysis of the minimum distance between the relocated epicentres and the lobate scarps indicates that eight of the 17 epicentres are within our criteria of 30km (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). To test if the proximity of the eight relocated epicentres is random, 10,000 sets of 17 random epicentral locations were generated. The results show that <4% of these 170,000 random quake locations occurred within 30km of a fault scarp (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and that none of the 10,000 sets produce more than five random quake locations within 30km of a scarp (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Even with doubling the minimum distance, only three of the 10,000 sets have eight or more random quake locations within 60km of a scarp (Supplementary Fig. 3d). This suggests that the close proximity of many of the relocated epicentres to mapped scarps is not random.

We next related the recorded origin times for the shallow moonquakes to the Earth–Moon distance (EMD) over the course of the Apollo seismic experiment. This revealed that of the 28 shallow moonquakes, 18 occurred when the Moon is closer to apogee (Fig. 4a), whereas eight events occurred closer to perigee and two occurred between apogee and perigee. In the EMD plot (Fig. 4a), a longer 206-day modulation due to the Sun’s perturbations on the lunar orbit is visible in addition to the monthly variation. Demodulating the time series (Supplementary Fig. 4) shows an evident non-random distribution in the timing of the shallow moonquakes (Fig. 4b). The 18 shallow moonquakes that occurred ‘near apogee’ were within 15,000km of the apogee distance at the time of the events (Fig. 4c). This grouping of events may reflect that the Moon orbital velocity is almost 114m.s–1 slower at apogee than at perigee, so there is more time for the stresses that accumulate near and at apogee than for any other place in the Moon’s orbit. Thus, we define events that occurred within 15,000km of the apogee distance to be near apogee events. We tested the possibility that the observed grouping of a small number of shallow moonquakes recorded by the Apollo Seismic Network near apogee and perigee is a random effect by generating 10,000 sets of 28 random events. By comparison with the recorded events, the median number of events in the 10,000 random sets within 15,000km of apogee is 12; less than 4% of the random sets have 18 or more quakes within 15,000km of apogee (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the distribution of random quakes is approximated by a normal distribution (Fig. 4d). The probability P of a random set having 18 out of 28 quakes that occur within 15,000km of apogee is ~0.01. We conclude that the observed grouping of events that occurred near apogee is not simply an artefact of the small sample size. Thus, of the eight relocated epicentres with surface solution within 30km of a fault scarp, six are in the set of 18 moonquakes that occur within 15,000km of apogee (Supplementary Table 3). If the limiting distance is extended to ~60km, two additional moonquakes occur within 15,000km of apogee (Supplementary Table 3).

If the shallow moonquakes that occur at apogee are related to coseismic slip events on the thrust fault scarps, their epicentral locations should correspond to regions of peak near-surface stress. The current stress state of the Moon is dominated by radial contraction from interior cooling, which contributes an estimated ≥2 but <10MPa based on the currently mapped population of lobate thrust fault scarps1,2. Superimposed on the compressional stresses from contraction σc are two components of tidal stress, orbital recession stress σr and diurnal stress σt. Modelling the tidal stresses22,23 shows they are dominated by σr, which may reach >200kPa (Supplementary Information). An additional component of stress that may contribute to the current lunar stress state is polar wander23. True polar wander has been attributed to a change in the Moon’s moments of inertia due to a low-density thermal anomaly beneath Procellarum24. The change in the location of the poles is consistent with the observed remnant polar hydrogen deposits24. Stresses from ~3° of polar wander σw over the past one billion years are on the order of ±8kPa (Supplementary Information).

Modelling shows that the maximum compressional stresses occur at apogee when stresses peak at a minimum of more than 2.2MPa near sub-Earth and anti-Earth points. Model strength envelopes for the lunar near surface indicate that stresses of ~2–7MPa are sufficient for shallow thrust faults to develop5. Peak compressional stresses >2MPa extend well beyond the regions around the tidal axes and encompass much of the lunar surface (Fig. 5). Due to the libration of the sub-Earth point, the local maximum compressional stress at any particular location on the lunar surface may occur a few days before or after apogee. An examination of the six near-apogee relocated shallow moonquakes within 30km of a fault scarp shows that all are located in regions in which the peak stress is >2MPa. A further analysis of the stress levels around the times and locations of the six near-apogee shallow moonquakes indicates that five occur at or near peak compression, or closely before or after peak compressional stresses are reached (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 3). Extending the limiting distance to 60km permits two other events to meet this condition (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3).

月球勘测轨道飞行器（LRO）任务为月球构造演化研究增添新篇章。LRO相机（LROC）获取的0.5-2米/像素高分辨率图像揭示了全球范围内广泛的瓣状断层崖网络。这些断层崖被解释为逆冲断层的结果，基于其形态、交叉关系、方向反转、段连接和建模。断层崖的小规模、清晰外观、与小直径撞击坑的交叉关系及缓冲和传统陨石坑尺寸频率分布测年表明其非常年轻（<5000万年），暗示这些逆冲断层可能目前仍活跃。

年轻逆冲断层崖群为研究月球近期应力状态提供了窗口，揭示全球月球应力的起源。断层崖的广泛分布证实月球近期经历了全球收缩。然而，断层崖方向的非随机分布与全球收缩的各向同性应力不符，表明潮汐力影响。建模显示，潮汐应力（轨道退行和日潮）叠加全球收缩应力，产生与断层崖方向一致的非各向同性压缩应力。在月球表面任一点，日周期内某一时刻达到峰值压缩应力。在远地点，潮汐轴附近日潮和退行应力叠加最压缩；在近地点，压缩应力最大点位于潮汐轴90°处。目前活跃逆冲断层的共震滑移事件可能在峰值应力时触发。

阿波罗12、14、15和16号着陆点的四台地震仪（1969-1977年）记录了28次浅层月震，里氏震级当量1.5至~5，体波震级>5.5，16次事件应力降≤10MPa，11次大于10MPa，其中3次≥100MPa。部分浅层月震的大应力降可能源于断层预滑累积应力。

当前最佳震中定位精度约为几度（60-90公里），对小型或远距离事件精度更低。浅层月震深度约束较差，估计从地表至200公里，近期分析建议深度为50±20公里。阿波罗地震数据质量限制了震源定位精度，但浅层月震与年轻构造地貌的联系可能表明月球断层现今活跃。

浅层月震位置和深度不确定性使得与已知构造特征的直接比较具有挑战性。我们分析了阿波罗地震网络记录的浅层月震时间，重新评估其震中位置和深度，以验证浅层月震代表年轻逆冲断层活动的假设，并检查月震时间和位置与月球应力状态的关系，判断月震是否发生在预测的峰值应力时间和位置。

为提高浅层月震的震中位置和深度精度，需改进定位方法。过去使用标准方法，通过已知速度模型和P、S波到达时间确定震中，但到达时间的不确定性导致位置误差较大。我们采用LOCSMITH算法，专为稀疏地震网络的不精确数据设计，仅需到达时间不确定性。该算法不求解单一最佳位置，而是通过自适应网格搜索，将候选位置分为已证伪和未证伪两类，考虑到达时间窗口的不确定性。每起月震的结果是一个候选位置云（图2b及补充材料）。Nakamura等人识别的28次浅层月震中，13次位置云包含原始震中位置，7次形成双位置云（两个分离的震中云，不含原始位置），8次位置云分散（震中约束较差，分布广泛）。可接受位置深度达300公里，但因断层滑移深度可能仅1公里（参考文献5），仅评估表面位置云。过去研究表明浅层月震可能源于地表或较深处（参考文献8,9,10,13），但散射特性测量显示，地表撞击事件的衰减时间与浅层月震重叠（参考文献14,17），支持浅层月震源于近地表。

20次重定位的浅层月震中，10次确认云和5次双点云在地表有解，共17个可能震中位置（图2b）。这17个云或簇均涵盖或靠近已知断层崖（图2b）。从17个云和簇中，基于与断层崖的最小距离选择17个震中，距离范围约3至292公里。为关联震中与断层崖，需设定月震与断层无关的极限距离。

浅层月震的地面运动范围取决于地震震级。月球地震波衰减远低于地球，破碎的月球巨砾层强烈散射地震波，形成超一小时的地震尾波（参考文献18,19）。断层附近强烈地震动证据包括小陨石坑的退化和缺失，影响范围达数公里（参考文献6）。陨石坑退化率也提供证据：阿波罗17号金牛-利特罗谷（约20.1°N, 30.7°E）的陨石坑退化率高于阿波罗16号凯利平原（约9°S, 15.5°E），且退化陨石坑的深度-直径比不随Lee-Lincoln断层崖距离（>15公里）变化（参考文献20），表明Lee-Lincoln逆冲断层滑移可能引发整个谷地的强烈地震动。

为评估典型断层崖上月震引发的地面运动距离，我们模拟了Mandel’shtam断层簇的地震动（补充材料）。最大地震矩基于Mandel’shtam断层崖的地形约束弹性位错模型，估算几何、深度和累积位移的最佳参数（补充图1和2）。根据Worden等人（参考文献21）的地面震动强度标度，垂直地面运动的强烈震动范围约30公里，水平分量约17公里（图3）。因此，典型断层崖滑移事件的地震动影响范围约30公里（月球表面约1°），用作震中与断层崖无关的极限距离。若包含中度震动，极限距离可扩展至约60公里（图3）。

分析17个重定位震中与瓣状断层崖的最小距离表明，8个震中在30公里范围内（图2b及补充图3a）。为验证这8个震中的接近是否随机，生成10,000组17个随机震中位置。结果显示，170,000个随机震中中<4%在断层崖30公里内（补充图3b），10,000组中无一组有超过5个随机震中在30公里内（补充图3c）。即使将最小距离加倍至60公里，仅3组有8个或更多随机震中在60公里内（补充图3d），表明震中与断层崖的接近非随机。

接着，将28次浅层月震的发生时间与阿波罗地震实验期间的地月距离（EMD）关联。结果显示，18次月震发生于近远地点（图4a），8次近近地点，2次在远近点之间。EMD图显示除月周期变化外，存在206天的太阳摄动调制（图4a）。时间序列解调（补充图4）显示月震时间分布非随机（图4b）。18次“近远地点”月震发生时距远地点小于15,000公里（图4c）。这种聚集可能因月球在远地点轨道速度比近地点慢约114米/秒，远地点附近应力累积时间更长。因此，定义距远地点<15,000公里的月震为近远地点事件。测试28次随机事件10,000组，结果显示近远地点事件中位数为12，小于4%随机组有18次或更多月震在15,000公里内（图4d）。随机月震分布近似正态，18/28次月震在15,000公里内的概率P≈0.01，表明近远地点事件聚集非小样本伪象。在30公里内8个震中中，6次在18次近远地点月震中（补充表3）。若极限距离扩展至60公里，另有2次月震符合条件（补充表3）。

若近远地点的浅层月震与逆冲断层崖共震滑移相关，其震中应位于近地表峰值应力区域。月球当前应力状态以内部冷却引起的径向收缩为主，贡献≥2但<10MPa压缩应力（参考文献1,2）。叠加的潮汐应力包括轨道退行应力σr和日潮应力σt，建模显示σr主导，可达>200kPa（补充材料）。极移也可能贡献应力，过去10亿年约3°极移应力σw约为±8kPa（补充材料）。

建模显示，远地点最大压缩应力在近地和反地点的>2.2MPa。月球近地表强度包络表明，~2-7MPa足以形成浅层逆冲断层（参考文献5）。>2MPa的峰值压缩应力远超潮汐轴区域，覆盖大部分月球表面（图5）。因近地点的天平动，局部最大压缩应力可能在远地点前后几天出现。检查30公里内6次近远地点月震，所有位于峰值应力>2MPa区域。进一步分析显示，其中5次发生于或接近峰值压缩，或在峰值压缩前后（图5，补充图6及补充表3）。将极限距离扩展至60公里，另有2次事件符合条件（图5及补充表3）。
